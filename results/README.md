## Results
This repository contains saved out results from the EDA, model creation, model fitting, and final model process.

- `eda_plots`: Plots for EDA on a portion of the training data

- `target_eda`: Distribution of the target variable across all data

## Model Fits
_2 dennotes the feature engineering recipe, without is the inclusive/basic recipe
